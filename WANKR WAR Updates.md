# **WANKR Wars — The Exponential Game**

This isn’t just an NFT project. It’s a case study in nonlinear game economies, a system where every mechanic feeds the next, turning a flat process into an exponential flywheel. We’re not building at the power of 1, we’re building at the power of 1.1, and compounding.

## The Core Game

* **_Weekly tournaments_**: run by WankerBot, all onchain, all in public feeds (X, Base app, Farcaster, Telegram).

* _**A 90-day tour**_: each week the bot randomly selects a new location with unique features. Different strategies rise and fall depending on the battlefield.

* Players enter with NFTs representing roles, rarities, and actions. Outcomes are skill-based but always carry a layer of chance; the upset, the underdog story, the moment fans love.

## The NFTs

* _**Revealed cards**_ – known roles/rarities to build armies.

* _**Unrevealed cards**_ – mystery boosters that grow scarcer over time, creating a parallel economy.

* _**Players must choose**_: reveal to compete, or hold sealed to speculate.

* _**Secret bonus**_: early participants may find they’re getting more NFTs than they expected. 

### Cause – Effect:

* Revealing strengthens decks – better tournament odds.

* Holding keeps supply tight – raises floor scarcity.

* Both feed trading activity – royalties cycle back into prize pools.

## The Economy

* Entry fees – prize pots.

* Royalties – partially recycled into rewards.

* Project-sponsored events – early months subsidized with fat payouts.

* Daily podiums + weekly champions – constant dopamine + clout.

* Final war chest at the end of 90 days  – compounded prize pool for top performers across the season.

### Cause – Effect:

* More play – bigger pots – more reveals – more scarcity – more trading – more royalties – bigger pots.

* **_Positive-sum flywheel_**: volume and rewards reinforce each other.

## Sponsorships = Racehorse Economics

* From your feed, just tag WANKR to sponsor a player.

* Sponsoring means paying the same entry fee as them, backing them like your own Secretariat.

* If they win, sponsors share in the prize pool.

* The player earns a 10% royalty cut of sponsor winnings on top of their prize.

### Cause – Effect

* Good players attract sponsors – bigger pots.

* Sponsors hedge their own play by backing consistent frontrunners.

* Top players turn into assets — their clout literally compounds into revenue.

* Underdog wins = legendary payouts for sponsors who spotted talent early.


## Why This Works

**_Most NFT projects are linear_**: mint – reveal – trade – die.
**_Wanker Wars is nonlinear_**: every decision branches into the next mechanic, feeding back into the loop.

* _Players win_: even average ones can podium with consistency.

* _Collectors win_: unrevealed scarcity grows as others reveal.

* _Sponsors win_: bet on players, hedge your play, earn ROI.

* _Royalties win_: fees recycle back into the ecosystem instead of draining out.

* _Narrative wins_: the Seabiscuits, the upsets, the underdogs keep the story alive.

This is exponentializing blockchain game theory; proving that when every angle is squeezed for value, what looks like a simple card game becomes the most lucrative on-chain social game ever created.

_Cheap to enter. Strategic to play. Profitable to sponsor. Underdogs can rise, champions can earn, and everyone has skin in the game._

The WANKR agent will serve as tourney ops, randomness, bracket style matches, card analysis after game with suggestions where recommended cards can be bought via WANKR BOT or facilitator to a P2P if someone has an unlisted card they are willing to sell or trade.

_The war is public.
The war is exponential.
The war is WANKR_


## Example Flow: A Week in WANKR Wars

1. ### Tournament Kickoff

* WankerBot starts the week’s tour.

* Posts the location (e.g. "Battle of the Blood Dune") with lore, Easter eggs, and environmental conditions.

* A dedicated location page goes live with terrain art, with hints.

* The narrative sparks public speculation: "_What cards will shine here?_"

2. ### Entering the Tournament

• If you like your odds, you just comment + tag WankerBot.

• WankerBot charges your entry fee on-chain and confirms your seat.

• Bot then prints out your available cards (deck inventory) and asks which 7 you want to field.

3.  ### Strategy in Public

* Players start theorycrafting directly in-feed.

* You can literally ask WankerBot: “Which Infantry types thrive in desert ambush?”

* WankerBot answers in public — so strategy talk is out in the open.

* Normally, games hide info. Here, we flip it: public AI coaching with shared metagame.

4. ### Matches & Progression

* Brackets are seeded.

* Each round, WankerBot posts matchups, rolls actions, applies scene bonuses, and resolves results with on-chain randomness.

* Upsets happen. Underdogs sneak through. Sponsors cheer for their racehorses.

5. ### Post-Match Analysis

* If you’re eliminated (say, Day 3):

• WankerBot generates a report card: deck strength, best action, weakest link, suggested upgrades.

• Report is public, so other players see what you need.

• Someone can reply: "I’ve got that Legendary Scout, want to trade?"

6. ### Marketplace and Sponsorship Loop

* WankerBot facilitates the trade – either from aggregators or via P2P escrow.

* Next week, your deck is stronger. Sponsors notice and back you.

* Consistent players attract more sponsors – bigger pots – more clout – more trades.

## Why This Works

* Lore + randomness keep the meta fresh.

* Public strategy levels the field but still leaves room for skill.

* Report cards fuel trades, keeping volume up.

* Sponsorships turn players into assets, creating new markets.

* Everything happens in-feed – no jumping apps, no walled gardens.

This isn’t just a game; it’s a live case study in how to turn linear mechanics into an exponential economy, compounding engagement, volume, and rewards week over week.

WankerBot isn’t just running the war. It’s running the market.


## The Birth of the Shame Soldiers

In the absurd halls of the Shame PsuedoScience Research Institute, Dr. Wanker Gyatt and his over-caffeinated team of "psuedoscientists" set out to engineer the ultimate Shame Soldier; a synthetic warrior forged from questionable equations, degenerate math, and copy-pasted whitepaper jargon.

But something went horribly wrong.

Instead of one controllable prototype, the experiment began spawning mutated soldiers every day; self-aware enough to know their role, reckless enough to be unpredictable.

* Day 1 – the Infantry spilled out.

* Day 2 – Cavalry broke containment.

* Day 3 – Artillery rumbled through...

By Day 7, containment finally snapped shut. But the damage was done.

## Aftermath of the Experiment

The Shame Soldiers scattered across 90 battlegrounds. Like insects, they spread and adapted.

* Each mutation has a home turf advantage — environments where they’re strongest, thriving like cockroaches in their element.

* But they can still fight in other terrains, just with less efficiency depending on environment.

* Some soldiers are desert-born, but can hold their own in wastelands. Others are ice-adapted but scrappy enough to march through swamps.

This makes every battle about probability and preparation; your deck must adapt to the terrain WankerBot unveils each week.

## The Broadcast

_The world is fractured.
The soldiers are loose.
The tour begins_.

This isn’t just survival. It’s strategy. And WankerBot is the only one brave enough to keep score.

_Day 1 Mutations sighted. Infantry units emerging from containment_. 


## How Rarity Works in WANKR Wars

Not all Shame Soldiers are created equal. Each day of the 7-day arc spawns 1,000 NFTs, but what you pull is determined by randomness and rarity numbers are estimated not exact on how much in each rarity.

### The Curve (per 1,000 NFTs in a day)

* Common — 60% (600)

* Rare — 25% (250)

* Epic — 10% (100)

* Legendary — 5% (50)

Every day; 1,000 cards split across 4 sub-roles in a specific unit (i.e. 4 different types of soldiers day 1 specializing in infantry.)

#### What This Means for You

* Commons = backbone of every deck. You’ll have a lot of them, but don’t underestimate them; some matchups flip the script.

* Rares = consistent performers. Bread-and-butter for tournament lineups.

* Epics = specialized tools. They thrive in the right Scene conditions.

* Legendaries = faction leaders. They don’t guarantee victory (chance always plays a role), but they swing battles and attract sponsors.

##### Strategy Takeaways

* Even a deck stacked with Commons can sneak into the top ranks, randomness keeps underdogs alive.

* Rares and Epics give you flexibility across multiple locations.

* Legendaries are scarce (only 50 exist per day), which makes them high-value both in battle and in the market.

* Holding unrevealed NFTs is its own play: scarcity grows over time as others open theirs chasing high rarity.

Rarity isn’t just about flex; it’s about probability, sponsorship clout, and trade dynamics. Every open, every reveal, every battle feeds the flywheel.

_The war rewards collectors, competitors and sponsors ultimately rewarding $WANKR holders._
